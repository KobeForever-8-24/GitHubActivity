Kevin is a general who is about to lead troops into battle. In recent day, he gradually completed the military task of assembling the troops, training the troops and preparing the food and grass. 
The night before the battle, Kevin came to see his unmarried wife Berry's room. He carefully told Berry whom to turn to for help when she encountered difficulties during the war and left enough money for her.
